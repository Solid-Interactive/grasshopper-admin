// Manifest file for all scss

// Import Foundation
@import "vendor/foundation/scss/foundation";

@import "views/login/login";

// Using Sass globbing to support importing directories.
// @import "views/**/*";

// FIXME: Sass is currently being imported into this manifest file explicitly.
//        A ruby gem sass-globbing was included in the gemfile and required in the compass config.ru
//        Though, it currently does not work.
//        Also, the Gruntfile Live-reload will compile all the scss files into css as well.
