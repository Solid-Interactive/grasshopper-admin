## 0.31.0

* Features
    * Adding ability to configure time zone for your application. Use the property `timeZone` in your `gha.json`. We use [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) to handle dates and time zone, so ensure the timezone you select is supported by moment.js and from [this list](http://momentjs.com/timezone/docs/).
