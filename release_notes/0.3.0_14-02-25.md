    * Grasshopper is now a NPM,
    * To install, npm install grasshopper-admin --save-dev
    * You need to create a gha.json in your root directory, this will point Grasshopper-admin to your API endpoint and buildDirectory.

        ```json
        {
            "apiEndpoint" : "http://localhost:9000",
            "buildDirectory" : "app/public/admin"
        }
        ```
