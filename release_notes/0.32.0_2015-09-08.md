## 0.32.0

* Features
    * Adding a template plugin. This plugin can be used to make 'computed' strings. The fields available to template are the actual content fields. So, if you are used to doing something like "fields.title", in this template plugin you would do "title". The template is recomputed every time the content changes. You need to use the "[[= field ]]" syntax style. This might be updated to the more regular "<%= %>" in the future. The plugin uses underscore templating.

    A valid template might look like.
    ```
    http://www.[[= title ]].com/[[= someOtherProperty ]]
    ```
