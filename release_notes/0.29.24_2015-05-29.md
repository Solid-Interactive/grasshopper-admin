## 0.29.24

* Patches
    * The slugification strategy used for `_id` on content types is configurable.
    * The default is camelCase, but you can also set `typeSlugification` in `gha.json` to the following:
        1. camelCase
        1. hyphen-case
        1. underscore-case
        1. onewordcase
