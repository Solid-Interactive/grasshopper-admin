* patches
    * Moved all icons over to font awesome.
    * font awesome is now a bower dependency instead of being loaded via CDN.
    * When selecting files in the rich text editor modal, it will automatically close the modal.
    * All Plugins now have the concept of simple vs complex dataTypes, this determines if they are allowed to have default values and if they can be 'switched' to easily.
    * All SCSS is now ripped apart into its own files. Cleanup of main.scss is in full swing.
