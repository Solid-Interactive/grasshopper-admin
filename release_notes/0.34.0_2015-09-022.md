## 0.34.0

* Features
    * Template plugin can be infinitely nested.
        You can now nest the template in any embedded type. It has access to its own scope via the `document` scope and the top level parents fields via the `parentDocument` scope.

        If you wanted to template the `title` field from the parent document and the `title` of the individual document you would do something like so:

        ```text
        Parent Document Title : [[= parentDocument.title ]],  This Plugins Title : [[= document.title ]]
        ```

        Any intermediary scopes will need to be gotten via accessors, ex : `[[= parentDocument.somethingElse.someThingNested.title ]]`

* Patches
    * The templates value itself is not accessible within the template which should prevent infinite loop.
